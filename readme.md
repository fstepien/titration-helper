App for quick plating bath calculation. When working in a analytical laboratory I used an excel spreadsheet to calculate parameters, here I use JavaScript to do the same in a mobile app. :computer:  :hourglass_flowing_sand: :green_book: :heavy_check_mark:

To start this will be a single bath calculator, then an app where users can add their own tests/parameters to local storage and finally create a database of methods/calculations to pull from.
